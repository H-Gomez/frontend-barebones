# frontend-barebones

A barebones front-end development environment which handles the setup of ESLint, Prettier, Parcel and other development dependencies.

  
# What's Included
### Dev Dependecies

- [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) - An opinionated code formatter setup to automatically stylise code when the package is run. This is responsible for formatting only - no code quality checking.
- [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) - A highly customisable Javascript linter. This will perform checking of code quality and is not concerned with code aesthetics.
- [eslint config prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-config-prettier) -  Turns off all ESLint rules that are unnecessary or might conflict with Prettier.
- [eslint plugin prettier](https://github.com/prettier/eslint-plugin-prettier) - An ESLint plugin that allows Prettier formatting changes and identifications to be shown as ESLint errors/warnings. 
- [parcel bundler](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel) - A blazing fast, zero configuration web application bundler
